# Bug report and feature request

For a bug report, please give me a way to reproduce the bug so it can be fixed.

Both bug reports and feature requests shall be made [there](https://github.com/lucas-by/vscode-samcef-language/issues/).

# Known issues/potential improvements

 - No auto-completion
 - No auto-closing parenthesis, brackets, etc.
 - Incorrect syntax might be appropriatly highlighted, code coloration does not mean correct syntax
 - Syntax highlight might not work with more "exotic" syntax I've never met
